            <p>ANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: It has indeed been an honour to host leaders from ASEAN and Timor-Leste here in Melbourne. I note that the Prime Minister of New Zealand also participated in the forum. This was to commemorate 50 years of partnership so that we can shape the future that Australia wants to see.

                Working with our neighbours and friends is delivering for Australians. It delivers jobs, opportunities and security. We live in the region of the world with the fastest growth in human history. That presents an opportunity from that proximity going forward.
                
                We have today adopted the ASEAN-Australia Joint Leaders' Vision Statement and the Melbourne Declaration, reaffirming our commitment to securing peace, stability, prosperity and a sustainable future for the region. We've announced more ways in which my Government is deepening ties with Southeast Asia.
                
                This includes establishing a $2 billion Southeast Asia Investment Financing Facility to increase Australian investment in the region in key sectors such as infrastructure and the clean energy transition. An energy cooperation package to support the ASEAN Centre for Energy and establish an ASEAN centre for climate change. Appointing ten Business Champions to facilitate greater commercial links between Australia and the economies of ASEAN. And I thank each of those ten business leaders who've agreed to be volunteers in this process to contribute to our national interest. Improving visa access for Southeast Asia. The establishment of an ASEAN-Australia centre in Canberra. More than 75 Australia for ASEAN scholarships with world class Australian universities. Our relationship with ASEAN is strong, but we can and we are doing more. Australia has so much to offer the region. ASEAN nations combined are the fourth largest economy in the world by 2040. Our two-way trade with ASEAN is now greater than our two-way trade with either Japan or the United States.
                
                Deepening our ties is about more jobs here. It's about more opportunities for Australians. It's about a more secure region as well. Which is why we are invested in our relationships. When I've said, spoken about our international engagement, I consistently speak about those two themes, investing in our capability, but investing in our relationships, both of them are important. And the opportunity that we've had with our neighbours over the last few days has been important in promoting Australia's national interest. And I thank all those who've participated, whether it be our visitors from ASEAN nations, or whether it be the Australian business leaders, those CEOs who participated in the forum over Monday and Tuesday. Happy to take some questions.</p>

                Bitcoin owes much of its rebound to a regulator long-viewed as hostile to crypto: the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC approved spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early January after suffering a legal defeat last year in its attempt to reject them. The move has widened the mass-market accessibility of Bitcoin, helping the crypto sector to turn the page following a bear market in 2022 and a string of subsequent bankruptcies, including the implosion of Sam Bankman-Friedâ€™s FTX exchange, according to a report by Bloomberg.
